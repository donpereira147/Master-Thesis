Emergency vehicles are bound to lose unnecessary time on their response. Furthermore,
research shows that emergency vehicles are prone to fatal crashes while on an emergency
call. Emergency vehicle’s response time is commonly affected by factors unbeknownst to it,
such as traffic, traffic lights, road conditions, and accidents.
The overall goal of this dissertation project was to improve the response time of an emergency
vehicle, while improving its safety along the route. Thus, V2X communications was
used to obtain knowledge from the environment, so that the emergency vehicle can choose
the best decisions to reduce the response time. The emergency vehicle issued alerts to all
of the entities of the road system so that these can adapt their behaviour collaboratively. In
this context, V2X communications may occur between vehicles and every other entity of the
system, such as infrastructures, pedestrians, vehicles, and the network.
The present document describes the research and development work that aimed to establish
a comparison between two scenarios: with and without support on a vehicular network
simulator, namely Veins, incorporating the American standard WAVE. The V2X scenario
benefited from use cases as emergency avoidance, dynamic routing, intersection and traffic
light’s logic. Alternatively, the non-V2X communications setup did not have access to communications,
simulating a current context for urban road environments. The evaluation of
the V2X benefits was made by analysing the most relevant criteria like response time, stop
time, distance covered by the emergency vehicle.
The performance of the system prototype based on these metrics showed a clear improvement
when using V2X communications. In particular, the response time was reduced by
41% using V2X, guaranteeing that the use of V2X is a step forward in this context. Since
the results from the tests using a full simulated setup were positive, a pair of additional
experiments integrating real Bosch V2X communication boards were planned: one with the
integration of these boards into the already simulated environment and another with the integration
of these boards on real Bosch prototype vehicles. While this later experiment was
not possible to realize during this dissertation work time, the former was conducted with
successes proving that the it is already possible to develop RD projects that use real V2X
communications boards, which is a step closer to test these new technologies on real environments
or, at least, on controlled environments that better emulate real environments.
